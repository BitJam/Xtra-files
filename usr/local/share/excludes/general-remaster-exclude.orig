# Additional files to be excluded when a general-purpose remaster
# is created.
#
# The original list is available in general-remaster-exclude.orig.
#
# NOTE: 
# The format is backward from what you might expect.  Paths anchored
# at the root of the filesystem have no leading slash.  Paths with a
# leading slash are relative.  *sigh*
